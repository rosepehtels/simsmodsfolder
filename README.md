# welcome to my mods folder for the sims4

This folder contains a template of my exact folder structure for organizing my mods. This is by no means perfect, and it's always changing. Use this to your advantage for organizing your own mods folder or take inspiration from it but **do not claim it as your own**. This structure was adapted from many creators and I am in no way claiming it as my own work. _It's just a template_.
